# SVC - Scalable Video Coding

H.264 extension allowing temporal, spatial, and quality scalability. Enables adaptive streaming where receivers can decode subsets of the stream based on their capabilities.

## Scalability Types

- **Temporal** - Different frame rates
- **Spatial** - Different resolutions
- **Quality** - Different fidelity levels

## Teams Usage

X-H264UC uses temporal SVC for adaptive quality.
