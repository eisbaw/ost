## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Dependabot alert #2 (high severity): The `openh264-sys2` crate has a heap overflow vulnerability in its decoding functions. Currently behind the optional `video-capture` feature flag so not compiled by default, but must be fixed before enabling video features. Update to a patched version of `openh264` (currently at 0.5 in Cargo.toml).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 openh264 dependency is updated to a version without the heap overflow vulnerability
- [x] #2 Dependabot alert #2 is resolved
- [x] #3 Project builds with video-capture feature enabled after the update
<!-- AC:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Updated openh264 from 0.5 to 0.9.3 in Cargo.toml. Adapted src/calling/codec.rs for the v0.9 API changes (new YUVSource trait methods, EncoderConfig/DecoderConfig constructors, BitRate/FrameRate types). Build passes with video-capture feature. All 91 tests pass.
