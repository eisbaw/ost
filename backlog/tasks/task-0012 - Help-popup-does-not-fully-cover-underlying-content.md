## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The help overlay (? key) renders over the messages pane but does not cover the full width of the content area. Message text bleeds through on both sides of the popup border, creating a visually confusing display. The popup should either cover the full content area width or use Clear widget to erase the background behind it.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Help popup fully obscures underlying message content
- [ ] #2 No text bleeds through around the popup borders
<!-- AC:END -->
